               <p>
                  Hi! My name is Koji Hirai, an aspiring engineer. I am currently studying Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Through various experiences and exposure to the vast range of engineering disciplines, I have ultimately learned that they are interconnected. Everything works together from a robotic arm, the circuits, and the software to control it all. In college, I am most interested in Electrical Engineering as the ability to use the microscopic formation of silicon in integrated circuits to control something much larger is truly mindblowing. I am most interested in electronics because of how much electronics surround us. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During my time in high school, I have participated in many engineering activities. One of the most significant was Gael Force Robotics. In my Junior year, I was one of the team captains where I successfully led our team to develop new strategies and techniques in our robot design. Although our season was cut short, I am proud of the anti-static design strategy that helped us optimize our performance by preventing electrostatic damage <a style="color:gray;" href="./Hirai_Projects.html">(See More in Projects Page).</a> As the Electronics Designer and Flight Test Coordinator for the sanitation drone project (Project TERSUS), I helped design the electrical system and integrated all of the electrical components. I was also the Vice President of the Environmental Sustainability Club, where I structured the project group system allowing new projects to be supported by club resources. I also assisted with conducting air quality research and led the development of underwater vehicles. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Apart from school activities, I am also active in my community. I volunteered at the Valley Childrenâ€™s Museum, a local STEM-oriented museum and served as the Teen Leadership Council member responsible for designing STEM activites. I am also a member of the Livermore Amateur Radio Club (LARK), where I participate in community technical meetings on radio technology and train for emergency communications. In my free time, I enjoy working with Arduinos and listening to Kpop. I am currently working on posting my past Arduino projects online to expand my interest in engineering in Japan where language barrier make accessing English resources difficult.
