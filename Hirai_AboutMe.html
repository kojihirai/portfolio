               <p>I find engineering to be very interesting and relevant for my future and my future plans. There any many types of engineering, but I find hardware more interesting than software engineering. Mechanical engineering is more hands-on where you build something physical rather than something virtual like in software engineering. Although I prefer mechanical engineering, I also enjoy software engineering and find that software is also important for mechanical engineering. In the future, I want to pursue aerospace engineering along with business to ultimately create my own company. I want to pursue aerospace engineering because I have been interested in aviation from a young age, and I find the engineering that goes behind airplanes to be fascinating. I also want to create my own company in the future, so I feel that having a business degree is essential.
                  <br>
                  <br>My proudest accomplishments are my accomplishments on the robotics team. I have been a part of Gael Force Robotics since my freshman year. My experience in robotics has taught me any valuable engineering and social skills. As a builder on the robotics team, I have learned engineering skills from the basics to the advanced. It taught me important qualities such as brainstorming, design process and trial and error. Being an experienced member, I constantly teach new members the fundamental skills in VEX robotics, which taught me effective teaching strategies and leadership skills. The robotics club has given me valuable skills in many fields and also expanded my interest in engineering and robotics. As captain of a robotics team, I want to be able to lead my team to be successful at the competition while growing their skills and having a fun experience.
                  <br>
                  <br>Outside of school and robotics, I am the Hardware Lead for the Environmental Technology Club (Enviro-Tech) and an active member of the Livermore Amateur Radio Klub (LARK). In the Enviro-Tech Club, I was one of the members to compete in the MATE Competition. The MATE Competition combined from robotics skills gained through VEX, my overall engineering knowledge from classes like Principles of Engineering into an underwater robot challenge. Building a remote-operated vehicle to operate underwater gave me very difficult but interesting challenges that I had never experienced when working on robots that operate on land. As a member of the Livermore Amateur Radio Club, I volunteer for radio communications at large local events like bike races. Bike races cover long distances and areas with no cellular coverage making standard communication impossible. As a radio communications volunteer, I help communicate emergencies and race status to the director.
