               <p>
                  I am currently a Senior at Dublin High School in the Engineering and Design Academy. I am currently the Public Relations/Event Director at Gael Force Robotics, where I spend much of my time after school. I also actively volunteer at the Valley Children's Muesum and the PLAY Foundation to help engage younger children in STEM activites. In my free time I enjoy working with Arduinos, photography and listening to Kpop. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In the future, I want to pursue electrical engineering along with business to ultimately create my own company. I want to pursue electrical engineering because I love to work with Ardunios to create small projects, and research how the circuits in everyday electronics work. I would like to pursue electrical engineering but I am interested in a field of aviation because since I was young I found the engineering that goes behind airplanes to be fascinating. I want to be able to work at the intersection of both of these field combining my passions togther to create something larger.

                  My proudest accomplishments are my accomplishments on the robotics team. I have been a part of Gael Force Robotics since my freshman year. My experience in robotics have taught me any valuable engineering and social skills. As a builder on the robotics team, I have learned engineering skills from the basics to the advanced. It taught me important qualities such as brainstorming, design process and trial and error. Being an experienced member, I constantly teach new members the fundamental skills in VEX robotics, which taught me effective teaching strategies and leadership skills. The robotics club has given me valuable skills in many fields and also expanded my interest in engineering and robotics.

                  <br>
                  As captain of a robotics team, I led my team to win awards at five consecutive competitions which included one Innovate Award, four Design Awards, one Tournament Champion and one Excellence Award. This was because of our optimized robot design and advanced strategies we as a team had developed in order to be the most successful during our matches. I developed a brand new, and unique anti static design strategy that helped us optimize our performance and ensured that our robot components will not get damaged from static electricity <a style="color:gray;" href="./Hirai_Projects.html">(See More in Projects Page).</a>

                  <br>
                  Outside of school and robotics, I am the Vice President for the Environmental Technology Club (Enviro-Tech) and an active member of the Livermore Amateur Radio Klub (LARK). In the Enviro-Tech Club, I was one of the members to compete in the MATE Competition. The MATE Competition combined from robotics skills gained through VEX, my overall engineering knowledge from classes like Principles of Engineering into a underwater robot challenge. Building an remote operated vehicle to operate underwater gave me very difficult but interesting challenges that I had never experienced when working on robots that operate on land. As a member of the Livermore Amateur Radio Club, I volunteer for radio communications at large local events like bike races. Bike races cover long distances and areas with no cellular coverage making standard communication impossible. As a radio communications volunteer, I help communicate emergencies to local first responders and race organizers.
