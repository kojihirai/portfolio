               <p>Through my experience in the Engineering Academy, I have had the opportunity to attend many field trips. One of the most notable field trips I have attended was the field trip to the California State University Maritime Academy. Prior to attending the field trip, I had always thought that college students learned in a classroom of thousands of students. During the visit to the California Maritime Academy, I learned that there are many types of education available in college. The most unique education environment that I learned about during the tour was their ship education. Students at California Maritime academy had the opportunity to be on a real ship for an entire summer and apply the skills they learned on campus to real-life scenarios. I thought this was a very interesting and effective way to learn concepts since you get to experience aspects of engineering that you can't really learn from a textbook. I also felt that the smaller class sizes and the tuition they offer is very appealing since I would get more experience and live a fun college life without drowning in loans. This field trip gave me a key insight into my future college plans. I had thought college was classroom-style learning with some hands-on activity at school. I also thought all colleges had insanely large class sizes and high tuition. By visiting the California Maritime Academy I was exposed to new schools I had never even heard of and the many types of options I have for college.</p>

               <p>Another opportunity I had through the Engineering Academy was the many guest speakers from many engineering backgrounds. One example is James Morehead who is a Product Manager from Google. Mr. Morehead gave a presentation about his work environment at Google, roles as a product manager and the process he went through when creating Google Bulletin. Google is a large software company, I had thought the only jobs were high executives like Chief Executive Officer and software engineers, but I learned that there are many other roles. The example he gave was a product manager. He explained that the product manager was the person in charge of coming up with an idea for a product, and making that into reality. They have to consider many factors like customer needs, the market, and then actually turn it into a reality. Mr. Morehead is the Product Manager for Google Bulletin, which is a platform where the ordinary person can share community events. I was particularly interested in the process he went through to create this product because it was something I have used in the past to share robotics tournaments and gave him feedback. He shared how he came up with the idea when he realized many community events should be shared with more people but there wasn't a place where people with no background can share events. He also shared the extensive prototyping and research behind the product before it was even brought to the user test phase. His talk gave me more insight into possible job roles in the future that I can purse.</p>
